# onboarding_name_app
The application generates cool-sounding names, such as "newstay", "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine". The user can ask for the next name, favorite the current one, and review the list of favorited names on a separate page. The app is responsive to different screen sizes.

What I learnt in this app:
- The basics of how Flutter works.
- Creating layouts in Flutter.
- Connecting user interactions (like button presses) to app behavior.
- Keeping Flutter code organized.
- Making app responsive (for different screens).
- Achieving a consistent look & feel of this app.
